# Bonfire Assets

WARNING: Currently under heavy initial development. More docs and stuff coming soon.

Bonfire's Assets package is a framework-agnostic Asset Pipeline implemetation for PHP 5.4+. 

Originally intended to use Assetic as the core, we decided to implement something simpler, and possibly not quite as flexible, that was lighter-weight and easier to maintain. It's implemented specifically for [Bonfire Next](https://github.com/ci-bonfire/Bonfire-Next), but should be usable in any project.
